# FinChain Analysis

This is our participation to the [Hackathon W3B Paris](https://www.hackathon-w3b.com/paris)!

## Overview

FinChain Analytics is an on-chain analysis solution.
With any protocol, we can clustering by profile of user.

All of our content created for the hackathon can be accessed on [this Notion page](https://mathis-hyperia-labs.notion.site/FinChain-Analytics-Hackaton-H-W3B-9effade675bf4b549297e8812300788d), including videos, pitch decks, business cases, and more.

## Where can I start reviewing this project?

### Data analysis
All of our data comes from data from [Google Cloud BigQuery Tezos](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/public-data-finance/crypto-tezos-dataset). The data is retrieved using SQL and imported into Power BI graphs.
All SQL scripts are available on the repository [data-analysis](https://github.com/FinChain-Analytics/data-analysis)

### Dashboard
Here's the [repo of the website dashboard](https://github.com/FinChain-Analytics/app). Due to the short duration of the hackathon, the live version is only available from localhost.
